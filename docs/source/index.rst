ReLife is an open source Python library for asset management based on reliability theory and lifetime data analysis.

* **Survival analysis**: non-parametric estimator (Kaplan-Meier), parametric estimator (Maximum Likelihood) and regression models (Accelerated Failure Time and Parametric Proportional Hazards) on left-truncated, right-censored and left-censored lifetime data.
* **Reliability theory**: optimal age of replacement for time-based mainteance policy for one-cycle or infinite number of cycles, with exponential discounting.
* **Renewal theory**: expected number of events, expected total costs or expected number of replacements for run-to-failures or age replacement policies.

To install ReLife2, use pip:

.. code-block:: console

   pip install .
